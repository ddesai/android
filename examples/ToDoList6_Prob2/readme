    Added following changes in ToDo_List_6 example
    • Add a button on ToDo List main view (either above the list view or bottom of the list view), name this button "Sync"
    • When the above button (or menu icon) is clicked, fire an Intent
        – This Intent shall launch a new Activity to represent "SyncScreen" (chose a layout of your choice to create this view)
        – SyncScreen has one line message about ongoing sync operation
        – SyncScreen has one button called "GoBack"
    • When GoBack button is clicked, an Intent is fired which will take user back to main screen of ToDo List
    • Add a Yes/No dialog box to confirm removal of an item from ToDo List
        – remove the selected item from the ToDo List if user chooses YES
